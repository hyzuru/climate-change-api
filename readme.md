# ABOUT THIS APP

This was based off Ania Kubow's youtube tutorial here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK4Pl-GmPHk&ab_channel=CodewithAniaKub%C3%B3w

The YT tutorial deploys to Heroku, which no longer has a free tier, so I have deployed to Vercel following this article - specifically step 3 (adding a module export line to my index.js code) and step 4 (adding vercel.json):

More info about configuring vercel.json can be found on Vercel's official documentation here:
